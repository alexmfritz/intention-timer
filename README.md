# Intention Timer

We created an application that allows the user to set goals for their health and productivity, tied to an amount of time. Users can:
  * Select an activity category
  * Set the amount of time spent that activity
  * Write a description of the selected activity
  * Start the timer

The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time.

View the final project [here](https://devonwigle.github.io/intention-timer/)!

## Instructions for use

Starting on the opening page you can select a category of "Study", "Meditate", or "Exercise".  Fill in what you would like to accomplish and the time you would like to spend doing it. Press the Start Activity button. Every category needs some interaction or error codes will populate.

The page will now show your current selected activity and timer, a color-matched circle, and the START button. Press START to begin your activity.  The START button will gray out as it is now disabled.  When your time is complete the timer will be replaced by a congratulatory message. A Log Activity Button will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Once logged you will be able to create a new activity by pressing the Create A New Activity button.  This will take you back to the New Activity page where you can once again select new options for your next activity.  This page also has the log of all your past activities, in a scroll bar on the side.
